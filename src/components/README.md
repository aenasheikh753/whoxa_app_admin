# Components

Reusable UI components organized by category:

- `ui/` - Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form components and form-related elements
- `layout/` - Layout components (header, sidebar, etc.)
- `common/` - Shared components used across the application

Each component should be self-contained with its own styles and tests when applicable.
