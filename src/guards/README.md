# Route Guards

Authentication and authorization guards:

- `AuthGuard.tsx` - Protects routes that require authentication
- `GuestGuard.tsx` - For routes that should only be accessible to guests
- `RoleGuard.tsx` - Role-based access control for routes

These components wrap around routes to control access based on user authentication and permissions.
