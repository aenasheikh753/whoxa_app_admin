 Custom Hooks

Reusable React hooks organized by functionality:

- `api/` - Hooks for API calls and data fetching
- `auth/` - Authentication and user session management hooks
- `common/` - General purpose hooks used throughout the application

Each hook should be focused on a single responsibility and include proper TypeScript types.
