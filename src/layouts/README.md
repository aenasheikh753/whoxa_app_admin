# Layouts

Layout components that define the overall page structure:

- `AuthLayout.tsx` - Layout for authentication pages
- `DashboardLayout.tsx` - Main application layout with sidebar/header
- `PublicLayout.tsx` - Public-facing page layout

Layouts handle the common structure shared across multiple pages.
