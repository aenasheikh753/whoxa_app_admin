# TypeScript Types

Type definitions organized by domain:

- `api/` - API response and request types
- `auth/` - Authentication and user-related types
- `common/` - Shared type definitions
- `index.ts` - Central export for all types

All TypeScript interfaces and types should be defined here for better maintainability.
